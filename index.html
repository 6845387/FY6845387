            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>
                Data breaches are a major threat to security of both individuals and organisations. 
                Losses from such incidents can include financial, legal, reputational and regulatory. 
                We start by covering the history of cyber attacks, and how they can be organised into 
                the three main categories: Credentials, Human Nature and misconfiguration, before 
                delving in detail on each of the three categories. For credentials, the problems 
                with passwords, MFA and disadvantages of MFA are covered. For human nature, both the 
                victim and perpetrator sides are covered. In addition, various examples are mentioned. 
                For all categories, statistics and explanations are referenced appropriately. We also 
                discuss some mitigations to reduce the likelihood of such incidents occurring in the future.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The world’s first cyber-attack, the “Morris Worm” began on 2nd November 1988, 
        causing a national slowdown of the US network (FBI, n.d.). This was a revelation in 
        the world of computer security highlighting the societal importance of computers. 
        Between 2001-2021, there was a 1517% increase in affected individuals (Griffiths, 2023). 
        Common causes of data breaches are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Credentials</li>
            <li>Human Nature</li>
            <li>Misconfiguration</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

        <h2>Credentials</h2>
        <p>Credentials are defined as one or more from a password, token or certificate to verify user identity (NCSC, n.d.). </p>
        <h3>Problems with Passwords</h3>
        <p>
            The cheapest to use credentials are usernames and passwords. However, they are vulnerable to 
            approaches like social engineering, brute force, and credential stuffing (CPNI, 2015). A brute 
            force attack is when random characters are used against a password input, to eventually obtain
            the correct password. As passwords have a minimum but not a maximum length, success is rare. As 
            85% of people reuse passwords (Bitwarden, 2023), credential stuffing attacks, where previously 
            exposed passwords are abused, are more successful. 
        </p>
        <h3>Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)</h3>
        <p>MFA is the use of at least 2 factors for successful authentication to prevent access even if 
            the password is compromised. Authentication factors are one of three concepts: Something you
            know, have or are. The first is a PIN or password. The second is an OTP (One-Time Password) 
            from an app, SMS, or hardware device. The third factor is biometrics, such as facial/iris/fingerprint, 
            which is invulnerable to theft. 
        </p>
        <h4>Problems with MFA</h4>
        <p>
            Depending on the additional factor used, there can be disadvantages. Firstly, if SMS codes are used, 
            it is vulnerable to SIM swaps, when an attacker impersonates the billpayer to activate a new sim to 
            intercept codes and bypass MFA. Secondly, due to phishing, where the password and code are intercepted 
            and forwarded, most OTP factors can be rendered useless. Currently, the only unphishable method is to 
            use a hardware token, like YubiKeys, which verify both the user and the server, with the FIDO2 protocol (Alqubaisi, et al., 2020).

        <h2>Human Nature</h2>
        <p>
            Human nature is a cause of data breaches.  They include, Kindness, truth-telling, and responsibility/negligence 
            from the victim and motivations, insider threat and social engineering from the perpetrator side. 
        </p>
        <h3>Victim</h3>
        <p>
            Altruism was observed in humanity over the past tens of thousands of years (Taylor, 2020), 
            and can be linked to cybercrime through “tailgating” attacks. This is when an unauthorised 
            person “follows” the victim into restricted areas (Fortinet, n.d.). Responsibility is a 
            major factor in cyber security. In many companies, most employees are not in IT (Sutherland & Powell, 2023) 
            and believe that cybersecurity is not their problem. However, 23% of attacks were the 
            result of careless/uninformed employees, see Figure 1. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Negligence is also a factor. Numerous instances of misdelivery occurred, where information is sent to 
            the wrong recipient (Verizon, 2018). In 2015, the email addresses of HIV patients were exposed to each 
            other twice, by the sender putting the emails in the “To” field, instead of “BCC”. The ICO (Information Commissioner Office) 
            fined the NHS Trust £180,000 (Chris Fox, 2016). 
        </p>
        <h3>Perpetrator</h3>
        <p>
            On the other hand, the main causes from the perpetrator side are insider threat and social engineering. 
            The four factors of insider threat can be explained by the “MICE” acronym (Burkett, 2013): 
        </p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>Money</li>
                <li>Ideology</li>
                <li>Blackmail</li>
                <li>Ego</li>
            </ol>
            
        <p>
            Money is a valuable commodity in society, making the insiders susceptible to being “bought” by those 
            willing to pay to get information. Ideology can cause issues when an organisation violates valued 
            principles, enticing them to leak or sabotage. Blackmail is effective when an insider has kompromat, 
            and threats to leak the material are made to force compliance. Finally, Ego matters, as insiders 
            sometimes consider themselves to be “above the law,” making it easier for an attacker to manipulate 
            such insider to leak information, while making them feel good. Secondly, social engineering is a 
            major problem, where human interaction is abused to capture information (CISA, 2021). Major events 
            such as elections, holidays and disasters are used to gain information. For example, when the NHS 
            were deploying new COVID-19 vaccines, scammers spammed the population with texts like this:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            “NHS: We have identified that you are eligible to apply for your vaccine. For more information and to apply, follow here: uk-application-form.com” (Ofcom, 2022).
        </blockquote>
